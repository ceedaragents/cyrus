# Platform Documentation

This directory contains the canonical documentation for Cyrus platform features and expected behaviors.

## Purpose

The platform documentation serves as the authoritative reference for:

- **Feature Specifications**: Detailed descriptions of how Cyrus features are designed to work
- **Expected Behaviors**: Documented patterns and workflows that define correct system operation
- **Integration Standards**: Guidelines for how components interact within the platform
- **Architecture Decisions**: Rationale behind key design choices and their implications

This documentation is intended for developers working on the Cyrus codebase, as well as contributors who need to understand the platform's intended functionality beyond what can be inferred from code alone.

## Documentation Standards

Each document in this directory should:

- Clearly state the feature or behavior being documented
- Provide concrete examples where applicable
- Distinguish between current implementation and intended behavior
- Include relevant architecture context when necessary

## Navigation

Documentation files are organized by feature domain. Refer to individual documents for specific feature specifications and behavioral expectations.
