# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Cyrus (Linear Claude Agent) is a monorepo JavaScript/TypeScript application that integrates Linear's issue tracking with Anthropic's Claude Code to automate software development tasks. The project is transitioning to an edge-proxy architecture that separates OAuth/webhook handling (proxy) from Claude processing (edge workers).

**Key capabilities:**
- Monitors Linear issues assigned to a specific user
- Creates isolated Git worktrees for each issue
- Runs Claude Code sessions to process issues
- Posts responses back to Linear as comments
- Maintains conversation continuity using the `--continue` flag
- Supports edge worker mode for distributed processing

## Architecture Overview

The codebase follows a pnpm monorepo structure:

```
cyrus/
├── apps/
│   ├── cli/          # Main CLI application
│   ├── electron/     # Future Electron GUI (in development)
│   └── proxy/        # Edge proxy server for OAuth/webhooks
└── packages/
    ├── core/         # Shared types and session management
    ├── claude-parser/# Claude stdout parsing with jq
    ├── claude-runner/# Claude CLI execution wrapper
    ├── edge-worker/  # Edge worker client implementation
    └── ndjson-client/# NDJSON streaming client
```

For a detailed visual representation of how these components interact and map Claude Code sessions to Linear comment threads, see @architecture.md.

## Common Commands

### Monorepo-wide Commands (run from root)
```bash
# Install dependencies for all packages
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests across all packages
pnpm test

# Run tests only in packages directory (recommended)
pnpm test:packages:run

# Run TypeScript type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Development mode (watch all packages)
pnpm dev
```

### App-specific Commands

#### CLI App (`apps/cli/`)
```bash
# Start the agent
pnpm start

# Development mode with auto-restart
pnpm dev

# Run tests
pnpm test
pnpm test:watch  # Watch mode

# Local development setup (link development version globally)
pnpm build                    # Build all packages first
pnpm uninstall cyrus-ai -g    # Remove published version
cd apps/cli                   # Navigate to CLI directory
pnpm install -g .            # Install local version globally
pnpm link -g .               # Link local development version
```

#### Electron App (`apps/electron/`)
```bash
# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Development mode
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build:all

# Run electron in dev mode
pnpm electron:dev
```

#### Proxy App (`apps/proxy/`)
```bash
# Start proxy server
pnpm start

# Development mode with auto-restart
pnpm dev

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

### Package Commands (all packages follow same pattern)
```bash
# Build the package
pnpm build

# TypeScript type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Run tests
pnpm test        # Watch mode
pnpm test:run    # Run once

# Development mode (TypeScript watch)
pnpm dev
```

## Linear State Management

The agent automatically moves issues to the "started" state when assigned. Linear uses standardized state types:

- **State Types Reference**: https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/variant/current/schema/reference/enums/ProjectStatusType
- **Standard Types**: `triage`, `backlog`, `unstarted`, `started`, `completed`, `canceled`
- **Issue Assignment Behavior**: When an issue is assigned to the agent, it automatically transitions to a state with `type === 'started'` (In Progress)

## Important Development Notes

1. **Edge-Proxy Architecture**: The project is transitioning to separate OAuth/webhook handling from Claude processing.

2. **Dependencies**: 
   - The claude-parser package requires `jq` to be installed on the system
   - Uses pnpm as package manager (v10.11.0)
   - TypeScript for all new packages

3. **Git Worktrees**: When processing issues, the agent creates separate git worktrees. If a `cyrus-setup.sh` script exists in the repository root, it's executed in new worktrees for project-specific initialization.

4. **Testing**: Uses Vitest for all packages. Run tests before committing changes.

## Development Workflow

When working on this codebase, follow these practices:

1. **Before submitting a Pull Request**:
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` under the `## [Unreleased]` section with your changes
   - Use appropriate subsections: `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`
   - Include brief, clear descriptions of what was changed and why
   - Run `pnpm test:packages` to ensure all package tests pass
   - Run `pnpm typecheck` to verify TypeScript compilation
   - Consider running `pnpm build` to ensure the build succeeds

2. **Changelog Format**:
   - Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
   - **Focus only on end-user impact**: Write entries from the perspective of users running the `cyrus` CLI binary
   - Avoid technical implementation details, package names, or internal architecture changes
   - Be concise but descriptive about what users will experience differently
   - Group related changes together
   - Example: "New comments now feed into existing sessions" NOT "Implemented AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage> for ClaudeRunner"

## Key Code Paths

- **Linear Integration**: `apps/cli/services/LinearIssueService.mjs`
- **Claude Execution**: `packages/claude-runner/src/ClaudeRunner.ts`
- **Session Management**: `packages/core/src/session/`
- **Edge Worker**: `packages/edge-worker/src/EdgeWorker.ts`
- **OAuth Flow**: `apps/proxy/src/services/OAuthService.mjs`

## Testing MCP Linear Integration

To test the Linear MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration in the claude-runner package:

1. **Setup Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/claude-runner
   # Create .env file with your Linear API token
   echo "LINEAR_API_TOKEN=your_linear_token_here" > .env
   ```

2. **Build the Package**:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

3. **Run the Test Script**:
   ```bash
   node test-scripts/simple-claude-runner-test.js
   ```

The test script demonstrates:
- Loading Linear API token from environment variables
- Configuring the `@tacticlaunch/mcp-linear` MCP server
- Listing available MCP tools
- Using Linear MCP tools to fetch user info and issues
- Proper error handling and logging

The script will show:
- Whether the MCP server connects successfully
- What Linear tools are available
- Current user information
- Issues in your Linear workspace

This integration is automatically available in all Cyrus sessions - the EdgeWorker automatically configures the Linear MCP server for each repository using its Linear token.

## Publishing

**Important: Always publish packages in the correct order to ensure proper dependency resolution.**

### Pre-Publishing Checklist

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: 
   - Move items from `## [Unreleased]` to a new versioned section
   - Use the CLI version number (e.g., `## [0.1.22] - 2025-01-06`)
   - Focus on end-user impact from the perspective of the `cyrus` CLI

2. **Copy the updated changelog to the cyrus website**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the updated changelog to the website
   cp CHANGELOG.md /Users/agentops/code/cyrus/cyrus-website/public/changelog.md
   ```

3. **Commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Prepare release v0.1.XX"
   git push
   ```

### Publishing Workflow

1. **Install dependencies from root**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install  # Ensures all workspace dependencies are up to date
   ```

2. **Build and publish underlying packages first** (if they've changed):
   ```bash
   cd packages/core && pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm publish --access public
   cd ../claude-runner && pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm publish --access public  
   cd ../edge-worker && pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm publish --access public
   cd ../ndjson-client && pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm publish --access public
   ```

3. **Install again from root to update lockfile**:
   ```bash
   cd ../.. # Back to root
   pnpm install  # Updates lockfile with published package versions
   ```

4. **Finally publish the CLI**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/cli && pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm publish --access public
   ```

This ensures that when pnpm resolves `workspace:*` references during CLI publishing, it uses the latest published package versions rather than outdated ones.
