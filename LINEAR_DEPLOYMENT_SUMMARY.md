# CYPACK-140: Intelligent Procedure Routing System - Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary

Successfully replaced the legacy three-phase execution system with an **intelligent procedure routing system** that automatically selects the optimal workflow based on issue content. During final review, discovered and fixed **4 critical production-blocking bugs** including a double-advance bug that would have caused every other subroutine to be skipped.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION-READY** - PR #313 approved for merge

---

## What Was Built

### Core Feature: Intelligent Procedure Routing

The system now automatically classifies incoming issues and routes them to the appropriate workflow:

**Four Procedure Types:**
1. **`question`** - Q&A with concise summary (no git operations)
2. **`documentation`** - Deep research with verbose summary
3. **`transient`** - Quick changes without PR creation
4. **`code`** - Full feature implementation with tests and PR

**Modular Subroutine System:**
- **primary** - Main task execution
- **verifications** - Run tests and linters
- **git-gh** - Create commits and PRs
- **concise-summary** / **verbose-summary** - Result summaries

**Example Flow:**
```
Issue Created ‚Üí Claude Haiku Classification
              ‚Üì
        "code" procedure selected
              ‚Üì
    primary ‚Üí verifications ‚Üí git-gh ‚Üí verbose-summary
    (write)   (test)         (commit)  (summarize)
```

### New Package: simple-agent-runner

Created reusable package for deterministic agent interactions:
- Enumerated response validation
- Timeout handling
- Error recovery
- Used by ProcedureRouter for classification

### Architecture Changes

**Removed (Legacy):**
- ‚ùå Three-phase system (closure, summary phases)
- ‚ùå Fixed workflow (same steps for all issues)
- ‚ùå Phase metadata (`currentPhase`, `lastCompletedPhase`)

**Added (New):**
- ‚úÖ Intelligent classification using Claude Haiku
- ‚úÖ Dynamic workflow selection (4 procedure types)
- ‚úÖ Modular subroutine system
- ‚úÖ Procedure metadata (`procedureName`, `currentSubroutineIndex`, `subroutineHistory`)
- ‚úÖ New `packages/simple-agent-runner/` package

## Critical Issues Discovered & Fixed

During final production review, **4 critical bugs** were found and resolved:

### 1. üö® CRITICAL: Double-Advance Bug

**Severity:** Production-blocking

**The Problem:**
- Procedure router advanced state **twice** per subroutine transition
- Once in `AgentSessionManager`, then again in `EdgeWorker` callback
- Result: Every other subroutine was completely skipped

**Real-World Impact:**
```
Expected: [primary ‚Üí verifications ‚Üí git-gh ‚Üí verbose-summary]
Actual:   [primary ‚Üí (skip) ‚Üí git-gh ‚Üí (skip)]

This meant:
‚ùå Code committed WITHOUT running tests
‚ùå PRs created with failing builds
‚ùå No verification step would ever execute
```

**The Fix:**
- Removed duplicate `advanceToNextSubroutine()` call from EdgeWorker callback
- State advancement now handled solely by AgentSessionManager
- Verified all subroutines execute in correct sequence

**Commit:** `0583db1`

---

### 2. üßπ Simplified Callback Signature

**The Problem:**
- `claudeSessionId` parameter was redundant (available via `session.claudeSessionId`)
- Confusing interface with unused parameter

**The Fix:**
- Simplified signature: `(sessionId, claudeSessionId)` ‚Üí `(sessionId)`
- Cleaner code, better maintainability

**Commit:** `0583db1`

---

### 3. üéØ Improved Routing Context

**The Problem:**
- Classification only saw description OR title (not both)
- Missing context led to inaccurate routing decisions

**Example:**
```
Before: "Fix the login bug" (description only)
After:  "Authentication Issue\n\nFix the login bug" (title + description)
```

**The Fix:**
- Combined title and description for full context
- Better classification accuracy

**Commit:** `b2b3110`

---

### 4. üîß Missing Procedure Routing for User-Prompted Events

**The Problem:**
- User-prompted webhooks (@ mentions in comments) bypassed routing
- No classification performed
- Sessions would fail or use undefined behavior

**The Fix:**
- Added routing logic to prompted webhook handler
- Consistent behavior across all session creation methods

**Commit:** `6a09154`

## How It Works

### 1. Issue Assignment / @ Mention

When an issue is assigned to Cyrus or the agent is @ mentioned:

```
Linear Issue Created
       ‚Üì
EdgeWorker receives webhook
       ‚Üì
Extracts: title + description
```

### 2. Intelligent Classification

```
Combined text sent to Claude Haiku
       ‚Üì
Model analyzes content
       ‚Üì
Returns: {
  classification: "code" | "question" | "documentation" | "transient",
  reasoning: "User requested a new feature...",
  confidence: "high"
}
```

### 3. Procedure Selection

```
ProcedureRouter.determineRoutine()
       ‚Üì
Selects procedure based on classification
       ‚Üì
Initializes procedure metadata in session
```

### 4. Subroutine Execution

```
For "code" procedure:
  1. primary subroutine (write code)
  2. verifications subroutine (run tests)
  3. git-gh subroutine (commit & create PR)
  4. verbose-summary subroutine (post detailed summary)

Each subroutine:
  - Has its own prompt template
  - Can specify maxTurns limit
  - Tracks completion in metadata
  - Advances to next automatically
```

### 5. Session Continuation

When subroutine completes:
```
AgentSessionManager.handleProcedureCompletion()
       ‚Üì
Advances to next subroutine
       ‚Üì
Invokes resumeNextSubroutine callback
       ‚Üì
EdgeWorker loads next subroutine prompt
       ‚Üì
Resumes Claude session with new instructions
```
