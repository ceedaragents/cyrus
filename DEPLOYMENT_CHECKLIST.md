## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Merge PR to Main

```bash
# Option A: Via GitHub UI (Recommended)
# Click "Merge pull request" on GitHub

# Option B: Via CLI
gh pr merge 313 --squash --delete-branch
```

**Verification:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git log --oneline -1  # Should show merge commit
```

### Step 2: Publish Packages

**IMPORTANT:** Publish in dependency order to avoid issues.

#### 2.1 Publish simple-agent-runner (NEW package)

```bash
cd packages/simple-agent-runner
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test:run

# Verify package.json version
cat package.json | grep version

# Publish to npm
pnpm publish --access public

# Verify published
npm view cyrus-simple-agent-runner
```

**Expected Output:**
```
+ cyrus-simple-agent-runner@0.0.1
```

#### 2.2 Update Lockfile

```bash
cd ../..  # Back to root
pnpm install  # Update lockfile with published package
```

#### 2.3 Publish core

```bash
cd packages/core

# Update version in package.json (if needed)
# npm version patch  # 0.0.36 ‚Üí 0.0.37

pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test:run

# Publish
pnpm publish --access public

# Verify
npm view cyrus-core
```

#### 2.4 Update Lockfile Again

```bash
cd ../..
pnpm install
```

#### 2.5 Publish edge-worker

```bash
cd packages/edge-worker

# Update version in package.json (if needed)
# npm version patch  # 0.0.36 ‚Üí 0.0.37

pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test:run

# Publish
pnpm publish --access public

# Verify
npm view cyrus-edge-worker
```

#### 2.6 Update Lockfile Final Time

```bash
cd ../..
pnpm install
```

#### 2.7 Publish CLI

```bash
cd apps/cli

# Update version in package.json
# npm version patch  # 0.1.22 ‚Üí 0.1.23

pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test

# Publish
pnpm publish --access public

# Verify
npm view cyrus-cli
```

### Step 3: Tag Release

```bash
git tag v0.1.23
git push origin v0.1.23
```

### Step 4: Create GitHub Release

```bash
gh release create v0.1.23 \
  --title "v0.1.23 - Intelligent Procedure Routing" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'NOTES'
## üéâ Major Feature: Intelligent Procedure Routing

This release replaces the legacy three-phase execution system with an intelligent procedure routing system that automatically selects the best workflow based on issue content.

### ‚ú® New Features

- **Intelligent Routing:** Automatic workflow selection using Claude Haiku
- **Four Procedure Types:** question, documentation, transient, code
- **Modular Subroutines:** primary, verifications, git-gh, summaries
- **New Package:** `cyrus-simple-agent-runner` for deterministic agent interactions

### üêõ Critical Fixes

- Fixed double-advance bug that caused subroutines to be skipped
- Added procedure routing for user-prompted webhook events
- Improved routing accuracy with full issue context (title + description)
- Simplified callback signature for better maintainability

### üì¶ Package Versions

- `cyrus-cli@0.1.23`
- `cyrus-edge-worker@0.0.37`
- `cyrus-core@0.0.37`
- `cyrus-simple-agent-runner@0.0.1` (NEW)

### üîó Links

- [Pull Request #313](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/pull/313)
- [Production Readiness Summary](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/blob/main/PRODUCTION_READINESS_SUMMARY.md)

### üìù Migration Notes

No breaking changes. The system automatically uses intelligent routing for all new sessions.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

None. All tests passing, CI green.

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Step 5: Monitor First Sessions

**Timeline:** First 30 minutes after deployment

Watch for:
- ‚úÖ Sessions start successfully
- ‚úÖ Routing decisions logged
- ‚úÖ All subroutines execute (no skips)
- ‚úÖ PRs created successfully

**Log Patterns to Monitor:**

```bash
# Good - Routing working
‚úÖ [EdgeWorker] Routing decision for <session>:
‚úÖ   Classification: code
‚úÖ   Procedure: code
‚úÖ   Reasoning: <explanation>

# Good - All subroutines execute
‚úÖ [Subroutine Transition] Next subroutine: primary
‚úÖ [Subroutine Transition] Next subroutine: verifications
‚úÖ [Subroutine Transition] Next subroutine: git-gh
‚úÖ [Subroutine Transition] Next subroutine: verbose-summary

# Bad - Would indicate regression
‚ùå [Subroutine Transition] Session <id> not found
‚ùå [ProcedureRouter] No procedure metadata found
```

### Step 6: Verify Key Metrics (First Hour)

Check dashboard/logs for:

1. **Procedure Distribution**
   - Expected: ~60% code, ~20% question, ~15% documentation, ~5% transient
   - Alert if: Any category > 80% or < 5%

2. **Subroutine Completion**
   - Expected: 100% completion rate
   - Alert if: ANY subroutine skipped

3. **Classification Latency**
   - Expected: < 2 seconds
   - Alert if: > 5 seconds consistently

4. **PR Creation Success**
   - Expected: > 90% success rate
   - Alert if: < 80%

### Step 7: Verify First 5-10 Issues

Manually check:
- [ ] Issue 1: Routed correctly
- [ ] Issue 2: All subroutines executed
- [ ] Issue 3: PR created successfully
- [ ] Issue 4: Verifications ran
- [ ] Issue 5: Summary posted

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

**Expected Time:** < 5 minutes

### Option A: Revert Merge Commit

```bash
# Find merge commit
git log --oneline --grep="Replace three-phase" -1

# Revert it
git revert <merge-commit-sha>
git push origin main

# Republish old CLI version
cd apps/cli
git checkout HEAD~1  # Previous commit
pnpm publish --access public
```

### Option B: Rollback Package Versions

```bash
# Users can downgrade manually
npm install -g cyrus-cli@0.1.22
```

### Option C: Hotfix Branch

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from previous working commit
git checkout -b hotfix/procedure-routing <previous-working-commit>

# Make minimal fix
# ...

# Fast-track merge and publish
```

```
‚ùå [EdgeWorker] Failed to create session
```

**Resolution:**
1. Check procedure router initialization
2. Verify Claude API key valid
3. Check Haiku model availability

### Issue: Subroutines skipped

**Symptoms:**
```
‚ùå Procedure advanced from primary to git-gh
```

**Resolution:**
1. Check for double-advance regression
2. Verify procedure metadata initialization
3. Review AgentSessionManager logs

### Issue: Classification errors

**Symptoms:**
```
‚ùå [ProcedureRouter] Classification failed
```

**Resolution:**
1. Check Haiku API rate limits
2. Verify prompt template valid
3. Check issue description format

### Issue: High classification latency

**Symptoms:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Classification took 8 seconds
```

**Resolution:**
1. Check Haiku API response times
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Consider caching for repeated issues
