# Internal Changelog

This changelog documents internal development changes, refactors, tooling updates, and other non-user-facing modifications.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Created `GlobalSessionRegistry` class for centralized session storage across all repositories, enabling cross-repository session lookups in orchestrator workflows ([CYPACK-725](https://linear.app/ceedar/issue/CYPACK-725), [#766](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/pull/766))
- Extracted `IActivitySink` interface and `LinearActivitySink` implementation to decouple activity posting from `IIssueTrackerService`, enabling multiple activity sinks to receive session activities ([CYPACK-726](https://linear.app/ceedar/issue/CYPACK-726), [#767](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/pull/767))
- Integrated `GlobalSessionRegistry` with `EdgeWorker`, making it the single source of truth for parent-child session mappings and cross-repository session lookups ([CYPACK-727](https://linear.app/ceedar/issue/CYPACK-727), [#769](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/pull/769))
