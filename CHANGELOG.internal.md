# Internal Changelog

This changelog documents internal development changes, refactors, tooling updates, and other non-user-facing modifications.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Created `GlobalSessionRegistry` class for centralized session storage across all repositories, enabling cross-repository session lookups in orchestrator workflows ([CYPACK-725](https://linear.app/ceedar/issue/CYPACK-725), [#766](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/pull/766))

## [0.2.19] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- Fixed labelPrompts schema to accept both simple array form (`{ debugger: ["Bug"] }`) and complex object form (`{ debugger: { labels: ["Bug"], allowedTools?: ... } }`). This resolves type mismatches when cyrus-hosted sends simplified configurations. ([#802](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/pull/802))

## [0.2.18] - 2026-01-23

### Changed
- Replaced manual TypeScript interfaces with Zod schemas as the source of truth for `EdgeConfig`, `RepositoryConfig`, and related configuration types. This ensures type safety at both compile-time and runtime, and fixes type drift where `CyrusConfigPayload` was missing fields like `issueUpdateTrigger`. ([#800](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/pull/800))

## [0.2.6] - 2025-12-22
