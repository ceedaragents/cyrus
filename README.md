Your Claude Code powered Linear agent. Cyrus monitors Linear issues assigned to it, creates isolated Git worktrees for each issue, runs Claude Code sessions to process them, and streams detailed agent activity updates back to Linear, along with rich interactions like dropdown selects and approvals.

**Note:** Cyrus requires you to bring your own Claude Code keys/billing.

## Getting Started

### Pro & Team Plans

Configure Cyrus through the dashboard at [app.atcyrus.com](https://app.atcyrus.com).

#### For self-hosted deployments

```bash
# Install Cyrus
npm install -g cyrus-ai

# Authenticate with your token (provided during onboarding)
cyrus auth <your-token>
```

For Cyrus to create pull requests, configure Git and GitHub CLI. See **[Git & GitHub Setup](./docs/GIT_GITHUB.md)**.

Keep Cyrus running as a persistent process:

- **tmux**: `tmux new -s cyrus` then run `cyrus` (Ctrl+B, D to detach)
- **pm2**: `pm2 start cyrus --name cyrus`
- **systemd**: See [Running as a Service](./docs/SELF_HOSTING.md#running-as-a-service)

#### For cloud-hosted deployments

No installation required. Everything is managed through [app.atcyrus.com](https://app.atcyrus.com).
