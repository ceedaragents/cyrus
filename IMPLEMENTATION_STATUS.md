# Cyrus I/O System Redesign - Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-19

## Summary

Phases 1 and 2 are **100% complete**:

✅ **Phase 1: Analysis and Design** - Complete architectural analysis and design documentation
✅ **Phase 2: Core Abstractions** - Full TypeScript interface package created and built

See `docs/io-system-design.md` for the complete design.
See `packages/abstractions/README.md` for interface documentation.

## What's Been Accomplished

1. **Created comprehensive design document** with full architecture specification
2. **Implemented `@cyrus/abstractions` package** with:
   - Agent abstractions (IAgentRunner, IAgentMessage, IAgentSession)
   - Input abstractions (IInputSource, IInputEvent)
   - Output abstractions (IOutputRenderer, IRendererSession, activity system)
   - Orchestration abstractions (IOrchestrator, IAgentRunnerFactory)
3. **Package builds successfully** and is ready for use
4. **Full documentation** with JSDoc, README, and type guards

## What Remains

Phases 3-8 need implementation:
- Phase 3: Adapter implementations (ClaudeAgentRunner, LinearInput/Output)
- Phase 4: CLI renderer (terminal UI matching Linear capabilities)
- Phase 5: Orchestrator implementation
- Phase 6: Language-agnostic integration test framework
- Phase 7: EdgeWorker refactoring
- Phase 8: Testing and validation

Estimated: 23-32 days of focused implementation work.
