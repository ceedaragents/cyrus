# npm install

```bash
$ npm install
â ‹ reify:lodash: timing reify:loadTrees Completed in 12456ms
```

I clone a new repo,
ready to go,
type npm install,
and wait until...

Minutes pass by,
I watch the CLI,
spinners keep spinning,
patience is thinning.

"Found 47 vulnerabilities"
(that's just formalities),
"Run npm audit fix!"
(that'll break the mix).

Peer dependencies,
competing allegories,
"Cannot resolve,"
problems evolve.

A package needs webpack 4,
another wants more,
webpack 5 required,
my hope expired.

Delete node_modules,
start fresh, it proves,
delete package-lock too,
try something new.

npm cache clean --force,
change the course,
pray to the gods,
beat the odds.

Three tries later,
no longer a hater,
it finally completes,
npm's bittersweet.

But then I see,
oh woe is me,
"This project uses yarn,"
back to the barn.

So whether npm, yarn, or pnpm,
dependency gem,
we're all the same,
playing this game.
