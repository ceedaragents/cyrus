# The Standup

```
Daily Standup - 9:00 AM
Attendees: 12
Expected duration: 15 minutes
Actual duration: ???
```

Nine AM arrives,
team convenes and thrives,
"Quick standup," they say,
"Won't take all day."

**Sarah goes first:**
"Yesterday I worked on auth,
today more of the same,
no blockers to proclaim."

Perfect, clean, and brief,
brings relief,
two minutes in,
looking to win.

**Then comes John:**
"So yesterday I started looking at,
actually first I need to give context,
remember that ticket from last sprint's text?
Well it turns out that connects to..."

Ten minutes later,
I'm a hater,
still explaining,
my patience waning.

**Product Manager chimes:**
"That reminds me of a time,
we should sync about the roadmap,
also the new feature gap..."

Fifteen minutes gone,
I stifle a yawn,
this "standup" has seats,
scrolling through tweets.

**Senior Dev speaks:**
"I disagree with the approach he seeks,
we should use a different pattern,
let me show you on Saturn..."

Screen share begins,
multiplying sins,
opening IDE,
breaking free from brevity.

**Someone's mic is on:**
background noise has drawn,
dog barking loud,
baby crying proud.

"Sorry, can you repeat?"
(defeat),
twenty-five minutes now,
I've forgotten howâ€”

What was I working on?
Yesterday's dawn,
seems so far away,
in standup's sway.

**Finally, my turn:**
lessons learned,
I speak with speed,
freed indeed:

"Yesterday: code. Today: more code. No blockers."
(like rockers),
short and sweet,
swift and neat.

**Scrum Master tries:**
"Great! Now let's revise,
quick parking lot,
for issues we've got."

Thirty-five minutes spent,
my morning rent,
stand-up complete,
now back to my seat.

Tomorrow at nine,
we'll realign,
and do this dance,
giving entropy a chance.

The irony's clear,
year after year,
a meeting designed,
to save time maligned.

But we'll persist,
can't resist,
the daily standup call,
standing or sitting, all.
