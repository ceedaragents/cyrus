# The Refactor

```javascript
// TODO: Refactor this mess
// Last modified: 2019
```

The code works fine,
every line,
but it's a mess,
I must confess.

"I'll refactor it,"
I commit,
"Make it clean,"
best code they've seen.

Day 1: I start,
take apart,
the first function,
after much discussion.

Extract a method,
as I said I would,
rename some vars,
reach for the stars.

Day 2: Tests break,
for goodness sake,
mocking is hard,
drew the wrong card.

Day 3: More breaks,
higher stakes,
edge cases found,
wisdom profound.

Day 4: Realize,
to my surprise,
that "ugly" code,
bore a load.

It handled things,
with hidden springs,
cases I missed,
now I'm dissed.

Day 5: Rollback time,
commit crime,
"git reset --hard"
plays my card.

The old code stays,
despite my ways,
working and ugly,
fitting snugly.

I add a comment,
my testament:
"This looks odd, but it's right,
don't refactor on sight."

Years later someone new,
just like me too,
reads my warning,
one morning.

They nod and think,
on the brink,
"I could make this clean..."
And the cycle's seen.

For refactoring's lure,
is strong and pure,
we all believe,
we can achieve.

Better code, cleaner too,
but we misconstrue,
working code's worth,
here on Earth.

So refactor with care,
if you dare,
test thoroughly,
and historically.

Remember this tale,
don't let it pale,
sometimes "good enough",
is the right stuff.
