# Git Commit Messages: A Tragedy in Three Acts

## Act I: The Beginning
```bash
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Fresh repo, clean slate,
conventions I'll create,
semantic versioning planned,
commit standards so grand.

## Act II: The Middle
```bash
git commit -m "fix stuff"
git commit -m "more fixes"
git commit -m "actually fix"
git commit -m "pls work"
```

Three hours past midnight,
nothing's going right,
the commit message field?
To chaos I yield.

## Act III: The End
```bash
git commit -m "asdfasdf"
git commit -m "FINALLY"
git commit -m "dont look at this commit"
```

The feature now ships,
with semicolons and quips,
but git log reveals,
what panic feels.

**Epilogue:**

Years later I'll see,
that commit from me,
and wonder aloud:
"What was I thinking about?"

But future devs will know,
from my commit show,
I was human that dayâ€”
in every way.
