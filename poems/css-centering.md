# CSS Centering: A Saga

```css
.center-me {
    /* How hard could this be? */
}
```

I need to center a div,
how hard could it give?
Just CSS they say,
surely there's a way.

Try one: margin auto,
only works lateral though,
horizontal is done,
vertical: none.

Try two: absolute position,
ancient tradition,
top 50%, left 50%,
but wait, there's more thenâ€”

Transform translate,
to compensate,
-50% both ways,
lost in the maze.

Try three: flexbox,
opens Pandora's box,
display flex I write,
justify-content: center feels right.

Add align-items too,
finally coming through,
it works! But wait...
now the width's not straight.

Try four: CSS Grid,
newest thing I did,
place-items: center,
one line, great mentor!

But IE11 cries,
"Not supported" replies,
my boss needs support,
back to the fort.

Try five: table-cell,
from design hell,
vertical-align: middle,
solve the riddle.

But semantic police,
give me no peace,
"Tables for layout?"
they shout and pout.

Try six: line-height,
works for text just right,
but only for one line,
two breaks the design.

Years pass by,
I still wonder why,
centering a div,
takes so much to give.

Now there's subgrid,
container queries did,
aspect-ratio too,
still we pursue.

The eternal quest,
to do our best,
and center things,
with CSS springs.

Future generations,
across all nations,
will they solve at last,
this puzzle from the past?

Or will they too,
like me and you,
search Stack Overflow,
for that centering flow?
