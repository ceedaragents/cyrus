# Stack Overflow

```python
def stack_overflow():
    return stack_overflow()
```

When the error appears,
confirming my fears,
I turn to the shrine,
where answers align.

Stack Overflow, my friend,
on you I depend,
your upvotes and marks,
your code syntax sparks.

I paste in my question,
with humble suggestion,
but before I can post,
a duplicate ghost.

"This has been asked before,"
the link they restore,
from 2012,
where answers delve.

The accepted solution,
my code's resolution,
was written in jQuery,
(do people still use that here?)

The top comment says,
"This is just a phase,
in three years you'll see,
there's a better way to be."

Ten answers below,
the debate starts to grow,
tabs versus spaces,
framework rat races.

But there, in the mess,
one answer, no less,
has exactly what I need,
to make my code succeed.

I copy and paste,
with appropriate haste,
add a comment of thanks,
(to climb up the ranks).

So here's to the site,
that codes through the night,
where strangers unite,
to make our code right.

Stack Overflow, we toast,
the questions you host,
the answers you give,
the reason we liveâ€”

to fix one more bug,
with a virtual hug,
from developers who care,
and knowledge they share.
