# The Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/my-brilliant-idea
# Opening pull request...
```

I've written my code,
borne its heavy load,
tested it well,
(or so I tell).

I click "Create PR",
my changes to star,
with description so clear,
no questions, I fear.

The CI pipeline runs,
its checks, one by one,
green checkmarks appearâ€”
success is near!

Then Slack notifications,
with trepidations,
three reviewers assigned,
my fate they'll find.

**Sarah comments:**
"Why not use a map here instead of forEach?"

**John replies:**
"Have you considered edge cases where the array is empty?"

**Mike adds:**
"nit: extra space on line 47"

I see their reviews,
their critical views,
my code's torn apart,
breaking my heart.

"You're right," I concede,
as I fix and re-seed,
my commits with corrections,
taking new directions.

Push after push,
through the review crush,
"requested changes" tags,
my confidence sags.

But slowly they approve,
my code starts to groove,
Sarah clicks "LGTM",
John says "ship it" then.

Mike's last nit-pick resolved,
my anxiety dissolved,
I hover on merge,
feeling the urge.

One final click,
the merge was quick,
my code is in main,
worth all the pain.

For code review teaches,
through its demanding reaches,
that better code we write,
when reviewed in hindsight.

Though ego may bruise,
from critical views,
we're stronger together,
in any code weather.
