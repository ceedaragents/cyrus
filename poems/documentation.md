# Documentation (Or Lack Thereof)

```javascript
/**
 * Does something
 * @param data - the data
 * @returns something
 */
function processData(data) {
    // TODO: Document this
}
```

"Code is self-documenting,"
they say, confronting,
the need to write,
docs in sight.

But six months later,
I'm a debater,
staring at my code,
like ancient ode.

"What does this do?"
I ask, it's true,
reading through the logic,
prehistoric and tragic.

Variable named `x`,
what the hex?
Function called `helper`,
helps with what, tell ya?

Comments are sparse,
terse andarse,
"// fix bug"
thanks, debug.

Check git history,
mystery,
commit message reads:
"stuff" (proceeds).

No README file,
not in style,
no architecture doc,
just code shock.

Try to run it,
"npm start" commit,
errors cascade,
charade.

Missing env vars,
behind bars,
no .env.example,
just mental scramble.

API endpoints?
Annoints,
trial and error,
growing terror.

What's the schema?
No Lima,
no swagger spec,
total wreck.

"I'll document it later,"
procrastinator,
famous last words,
for code nerds.

But later never comes,
succumbs,
to feature pressure,
no treasure.

So here's my confession,
obsession,
I too have sinned,
documentation binned.

Promised myself,
on the shelf,
"Next project I'll do it right,"
(spoiler: not quite).

But maybe this time,
I'll climb,
write it as I go,
let knowledge flow.

README first,
quench the thirst,
comments inline,
design by design.

JSDoc for functions,
proper junctions,
types defined,
peace of mind.

Architecture diagrams,
proper grams,
decision records too,
through and through.

Because good docs,
unlocks,
not just for others to read,
but future me in need.

When I return,
and discern,
what past me wrought,
I'll appreciate the thought.

So document today,
pave the way,
for tomorrow's confusion,
in conclusion:

Code may be self-documenting,
but I'm still lamenting,
for context and why,
comments supply.
