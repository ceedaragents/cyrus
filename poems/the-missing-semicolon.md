# The Missing Semicolon

```c
int main() {
    printf("Hello World")  // Missing semicolon
    return 0;
}
```

For hours I searched,
my codebase I traversed,
five hundred lines,
looking for signs.

The compiler said,
with words of dread,
"Error on line 502"
(that's not what's true).

I check that line,
it looks just fine,
perfect syntax there,
I pull my hair.

I check the next,
utterly perplexed,
and the one before,
still nothing's wrong in this war.

Stack Overflow scoured,
my confidence devoured,
Reddit threads read,
docs in my head.

I add debug prints,
follow all hints,
comment out blocks,
pick every lock.

Then I see it there,
with a thousand-yard stare,
on line 487,
code from heaven.

A missing semicolon,
so small and stolen,
just one character,
my time's disaster.

I add the mark,
tiny little arc,
hit compile again,
success and thenâ€”

It works perfectly,
executed correctly,
all tests pass,
I fall on the grass.

Three hours gone,
from dusk to dawn,
for a single dot,
that I forgot.

This is the life,
of debugging strife,
where tiny things,
pull our strings.
