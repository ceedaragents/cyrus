# Ode to Semicolons

```python
# In Python we're free
# No semicolons to see
```

Oh semicolon, tiny friend,
JavaScript code you defend,
though ASI tries to spare,
we place you everywhere.

In C you're required,
without you we're fired,
the compiler will scream,
and shatter our dream.

But Python said "no more!"
showed you to the door,
with whitespace instead,
(tabs vs spaces—bloodshed).

Go borrowed from C,
but set the syntax free,
optional grace,
yet kept the embrace.

So here's to you, little dot-comma-thing,
the debates that you bring,
across languages we roam—
in some, you're home;
in others, you're banned;
but we understand:

You're not just punctuation,
you're a whole generation
of programmers debating
whether you're worth creating.
