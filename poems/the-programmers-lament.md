# The Programmer's Lament

```
TODO: Refactor this entire file
FIXME: Why does this even work?
HACK: Don't judge me
```

I wake up in the morning,
with a feature request warning,
"just a small change," they say,
"it'll only take a day."

But the codebase is old,
its secrets untold,
comments from 2009,
functions without design.

I trace through the stack,
following breadcrumbs back,
to find the root cause,
(there are no docs, because...)

The developer who wrote it,
never quite thought it,
would live beyond next week,
now I'm playing hide-and-seek.

Dependencies are nested,
ten levels deep, untested,
one package is deprecated,
my hopes are deflated.

The tests? Oh, they pass!
(by mocking the entire class),
100% coverage showing,
0% truth knowing.

I write my small change,
feeling quite strange,
as three things break,
for backwards-compat's sake.

Six hours later, done,
this battle I've won,
I push to main (we have no branches),
taking my chances.

The PM says "great!",
(I stayed up quite late),
"Just one more thing to doâ€”
can you add dark mode too?"

And so the cycle goes,
as every coder knows,
we fix, we patch, we pray,
living to code another day.
