# The Infinite Loop

```javascript
while(true) {
  console.log("Still searching...");
}
```

I coded through the night,
debugging by moonlight,
my loop without break,
my one last mistake—
now Chrome tabs multiply,
RAM starts to cry,
the fan begins spinning,
my patience is thinning.

I click the red X,
my program objects,
one process remains,
despite all my pains.

The truth I must face:
there's no escape from this place—
just Ctrl+Alt+Delete,
and admit my defeat.
