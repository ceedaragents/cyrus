# undefined is not a function

```javascript
const x = undefined;
x(); // TypeError: undefined is not a function
```

I called upon a function,
with hope and good intention,
but JavaScript had other plans,
slipping through my hands.

"undefined is not a function,"
the error brings destruction,
to my carefully built code,
down debugging road I strode.

Was it null? Was it undefined?
Optional chaining, I declined!
The stack trace mocks my pain,
line numbers once again.

I check the console log,
through the error fog,
and there, with shame, I see:
a typo stares at me.

Not `getData()` but `getDat()`,
imagine that,
one letter missed,
my function dismissed.

So now I'll write with care,
add TypeScript everywhere,
and maybe, just maybe, tonight,
my functions will be defined... right?
