# Recent Changes Analysis for CEA-136: Prompt Iteration

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the evolution of the Cyrus prompt system over the past 6 months, focusing on key changes to prompting, agent behavior, and issue handling. The codebase has undergone significant architectural improvements, with particular emphasis on streaming capabilities, context preservation, and user experience refinements.

## Timeline of Major Changes

### July 2024 (Latest)
- **Streaming Input Implementation** (commit `66c8a38`, July 4, 2025)
  - Added `StreamingPrompt` class implementing `AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>`
  - Modified `ClaudeRunner` to support both string and streaming prompt modes
  - Added `startStreaming()` method and `addStreamMessage()` for continuous conversations
  - Updated `EdgeWorker` to use streaming instead of killing/restarting sessions
  - **Impact**: Eliminates session restarts for follow-up comments, preserving context better

### June 2024 (Peak Activity Period)
- **Context Loss Fix** (commit `3fc6940`, June 25, 2025)
  - Fixed critical issue where follow-up comments lost repository and issue context
  - Added `buildContinuationPrompt()` method to provide essential context for mentions
  - Replaced raw comment body with structured continuation prompt
  - **Impact**: Ensures all follow-up interactions have proper context

- **Initial Comment Text Refinement** (commit `b922507`, June 20, 2025)
  - Changed from "I've been assigned to this issue" to "I'll get started right away"
  - More direct and action-oriented messaging
  - **Impact**: Better user experience, clearer intent

- **TODO Formatting Improvements** (commit `9199c80`, June 15, 2025)
  - Removed colored dots (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢) from TODO priority formatting in Linear posts
  - Kept functional indicators (ðŸ”„ for in-progress, checkboxes for status)
  - **Impact**: Cleaner appearance in Linear interface

- **Custom Prompt Template Restrictions** (commit `c696afc`, June 13, 2025)
  - Stripped `promptTemplatePath` from repository configurations
  - Ensured built-in template is always used in CLI mode
  - **Impact**: Standardized prompt behavior across deployments

### May 2024 (Architecture Improvements)
- **Edge Worker Architecture** (multiple commits)
  - Transitioned from Server-Sent Events to webhook-only architecture
  - Implemented shared webhook server to eliminate port conflicts
  - Added comprehensive attachment download functionality
  - **Impact**: More reliable real-time communication

- **TypeScript Migration** (commit `25c2d0f` and related)
  - Migrated apps/cli from JavaScript to TypeScript
  - Improved type safety and eliminated 'any' types
  - Enhanced Linear SDK integration with proper types
  - **Impact**: Better code quality and maintainability

## Key Problem Areas Addressed

### 1. Context Loss in Conversations
**Problem**: Follow-up comments and mentions were losing essential context about the repository, issue, and working directory.

**Solution**: 
- Added `buildContinuationPrompt()` method that reconstructs context
- Includes repository name, issue details, state, and working directory
- Maintains conversation flow without full session restarts

**Code Location**: `packages/edge-worker/src/EdgeWorker.ts:850-896`

### 2. Session Management Complexity
**Problem**: Each new comment required killing and restarting Claude sessions, losing conversation history.

**Solution**:
- Implemented streaming input using `AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>`
- Added `addStreamMessage()` to feed new messages to existing streams
- Fallback to restart behavior if streaming fails

**Code Location**: `packages/claude-runner/src/ClaudeRunner.ts`

### 3. User Experience Issues
**Problem**: Initial messages were too formal, TODO formatting was cluttered.

**Solutions**:
- Changed initial comment to more direct "I'll get started right away"
- Removed colored priority dots while keeping functional indicators
- Improved comment threading behavior

### 4. Template Customization Problems
**Problem**: Inconsistent template usage across different deployment modes.

**Solution**:
- Enforced use of built-in template in CLI mode
- Standardized template loading hierarchy
- Prevented custom templates from being persisted inappropriately

## Current Prompt System Architecture

### Template Structure
The active template (`packages/edge-worker/prompt-template.md`) follows a two-situation pattern:
1. **Situation 1 - Execute**: Clear requirements â†’ systematic implementation
2. **Situation 2 - Clarify**: Vague requirements â†’ investigation and clarification

### Key Features
- **TODO Tool Integration**: Mandatory use of TodoWrite/TodoRead for progress tracking
- **Branching Logic**: Automatic branch and PR management
- **Context Variables**: 15+ template variables for comprehensive context
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time updates to Linear comments
- **Attachment Support**: Automatic download and integration of issue attachments

### Template Variables
- Repository: `{{repository_name}}`
- Issue: `{{issue_id}}`, `{{issue_title}}`, `{{issue_description}}`
- State: `{{issue_state}}`, `{{issue_priority}}`, `{{issue_url}}`
- Context: `{{comment_history}}`, `{{latest_comment}}`
- Environment: `{{working_directory}}`, `{{base_branch}}`, `{{branch_name}}`

## Identified Pain Points and Opportunities

### 1. Situation Detection Logic
**Current**: Relies on Claude to determine if requirements are clear enough for execution
**Opportunity**: Could implement automated analysis of issue structure, acceptance criteria presence, etc.

### 2. Prompt Length Management
**Current**: Prompts can become very long with extensive comment history
**Opportunity**: Implement smart truncation or summarization for long conversations

### 3. Template Customization
**Current**: Limited customization options in CLI mode
**Opportunity**: Allow repository-specific overrides for certain sections while maintaining core structure

### 4. Error Recovery
**Current**: Basic fallback prompt when template processing fails
**Opportunity**: More sophisticated error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 5. Attachment Integration
**Current**: Attachments are downloaded and listed in manifest
**Opportunity**: Better integration of attachment content into prompt context

## Recent Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements

### Major Fixes
1. **Context Loss in Continuations** - Fixed agent losing context in follow-up comments
2. **@ Mention Handling** - Fixed agent triggering on mentions of other users
3. **State Management** - Fixed agent setting issues to wrong states on assignment
4. **Command Injection** - Fixed branch name sanitization to prevent backtick injection
5. **Streaming Reliability** - Fixed various issues with real-time comment updates

### Configuration Issues
1. **Environment Variables** - Standardized CYRUS_* prefixes for all config
2. **OAuth Callbacks** - Fixed callback URL configuration for different deployments
3. **Webhook Architecture** - Migrated from SSE to webhooks for better reliability

## Development Momentum and Patterns

### Active Development Areas
1. **Streaming and Real-time Updates** - Continuous improvements to comment streaming
2. **Architecture Simplification** - Moving toward webhook-only, shared server model
3. **Type Safety** - Ongoing TypeScript migration and type improvements
4. **User Experience** - Constant refinement of agent messaging and behavior

### Emerging Patterns
1. **Context Preservation** - Strong focus on maintaining conversation context
2. **Standardization** - Enforcing consistent behavior across deployment modes
3. **Reliability** - Prioritizing stability over feature additions
4. **Tool Integration** - Heavy emphasis on TODO tool usage for progress tracking
