**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE AND READY FOR MERGE**
**PR:** #313 - https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/pull/313
**Branch:** cypack-140 → main

## 📊 Work Completed

### Major Deliverables

1. ✅ **ProcedureRouter Integration** - Intelligent workflow selection based on request content
2. ✅ **Legacy Code Removal** - Eliminated 115 lines of three-phase system code
3. ✅ **CI/CD Fixed** - Resolved lockfile issues, all checks passing
4. ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** - 390-line technical summary + user-focused changelog
5. ✅ **Production Readiness** - Full testing, verification, and monitoring plan

### What Changed

**Before:** All tasks forced through three phases (primary → closure → summary)
**After:** Intelligent routing selects appropriate workflow based on request type

- **Simple questions** → Quick answer (concise summary only)
- **Documentation edits** → Direct implementation + concise summary
- **Transient operations** → Quick fix + concise summary
- **Code changes** → Full workflow (verifications + git + verbose summary)

**Classification:** Uses "haiku" model, completes in <10 seconds

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified (4 core files)

**1. EdgeWorker.ts**
- Initialized ProcedureRouter in constructor (lines 105-110)
- Session initialization calls `determineRoutine()` for classification (lines 999-1017)
- Subroutine transitions via `resumeNextPhase` callback (lines 240-329)
- Passes procedureRouter to AgentSessionManager

**2. AgentSessionManager.ts**
- Accepts ProcedureRouter in constructor
- Uses `handleProcedureCompletion()` for procedure-based flow
- Removed `handleLegacyPhaseCompletion()` method (93 lines)
- No backward compatibility - clean break from phases

**3. ProcedureRouter.ts**
- Fixed ES module imports (was using CommonJS `require()`)
- Proper integration with SimpleClaudeRunner
- Four classification types: question, documentation, transient, code
- Fallback to full-development on errors

**4. package.json (edge-worker & simple-agent-runner)**
- Updated build script to only copy subroutine prompts
- Updated claude-agent-sdk to v0.1.10 (consistency fix)

### Files Deleted

- `packages/edge-worker/src/prompts/phase-closure.md`
- `packages/edge-worker/src/prompts/phase-summary.md`

### Integration Points Verified

1. ✅ ProcedureRouter initialization with haiku model
2. ✅ Routing decision at session creation
3. ✅ Procedure metadata initialization
4. ✅ Subroutine transition handling
5. ✅ Completion flow with next subroutine checks
6. ✅ Prompt file loading with fallbacks
7. ✅ MaxTurns enforcement per subroutine

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Module Import Error (Critical)
**Problem:** ProcedureRouter used CommonJS `require()` in ES module
**Impact:** All 68 tests failing, blocking production
**Fix:** Changed to ES module `import` statement
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue #2: Legacy Phase Metadata (Medium)
**Problem:** `handleUserPostedAgentActivity` still initialized phase metadata
**Impact:** Confusion, memory waste, inconsistency
**Fix:** Removed phase initialization code (22 lines)
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue #3: CI Lockfile Mismatch (Critical)
**Problem:** simple-agent-runner used v0.1.8 while others used v0.1.10
**Impact:** CI failing with lockfile error
**Fix:** Updated to v0.1.10, regenerated lockfile
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue #4: Build Script Error (Minor)
**Problem:** Build tried to copy non-existent phase prompt files
**Impact:** Build failure
**Fix:** Updated script to only copy subroutine prompts
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

## 📋 Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Merge (Immediate)
1. Merge PR #313 to main
2. Verify merge successful
3. Tag release if needed

### Phase 2: Deploy (Within 1 hour)
1. Pull latest main
2. Run `pnpm install && pnpm build`
3. Deploy to production using standard process
4. Verify health endpoints

### Phase 3: Monitor (First 24 hours)
**Watch for:**
- Error rate increases (rollback if >10% increase)
- Classification timeouts (rollback if >50% timeout)
- Sessions stuck in routing phase
- User reports of inappropriate workflows

**Log Monitoring:**
```bash
# Look for routing decisions
grep "[EdgeWorker] Routing decision for" logs/

# Check for errors
grep "ERROR\|WARN" logs/ | grep -i procedure
```

### Phase 4: Verify (First week)
**Collect metrics:**
- % using each procedure (question/documentation/transient/code)
- Average execution time by procedure
- User satisfaction feedback
- Classification accuracy (manual spot checks)

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

**If critical issues arise:**

### Quick Revert (Recommended)
```bash
git revert <merge-commit-sha> -m 1
git push origin main
pnpm install && pnpm build
# Deploy
```

### Rollback Triggers
- **Immediate:** >50% classification timeouts
- **Immediate:** >10% error rate increase
- **Immediate:** System unresponsive
- **High Priority:** Consistent inappropriate workflow selection

**Note:** Phase prompts preserved in git history at commit `eeb1853`
