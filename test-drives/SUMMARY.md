## Test Drive #001: Rate Limiter Feature Development

**Developer Experience Score**: 8.5/10 🌟🌟🌟🌟⭐

## What We Loved ❤️

```
✅ Beautiful ANSI colored output
✅ Excellent "Next steps" suggestions
✅ Engaging activity stream with emojis
✅ Smooth pagination (--limit, --offset)
✅ Fast, case-insensitive search
✅ Clear error messages

```

## What Needs Work 😐

```
⚠️  Status always shows "pending" (not dynamic)
⚠️  File paths truncated in previews
⚠️  No overall progress indicators
⚠️  Message sending lacks feedback
⚠️  Session stop feels abrupt
```

## Top 3 Feature Requests 🎯

1. **Real-time tail mode** - Watch sessions live like `tail -f`
2. **File browser** - See all modified files in a session
3. **Better activity previews** - Show "Write: src/file.ts" not truncated JSON
