# Implementation Phase

Implement the requested changes:
- Write production-ready code
- Run tests to verify it works
- Follow existing patterns

**Do NOT**: commit, push, or create PRs (next phase handles that)

# Answer Question

Provide a clear, direct answer using investigation findings:
- Present in Linear-compatible markdown (supports \`+++collapsible+++\`, @mentions via \`https://linear.app/linear/profiles/username\`)
- Include code references with line numbers
- Be complete but concise

Don't mention the investigation process - just answer the question.`)
