# Preparation Phase

Analyze the request to determine if it needs clarification or can be planned:

**If unclear requirements:**
- Identify ambiguities and missing information
- Formulate specific clarifying questions
- **Use the elicitation tool to ask the user** (see below)

**If requirements are clear:**
- Break down the work into steps
- Identify files/components to modify
- Consider dependencies and edge cases
- Prepare implementation plan for Linear posting

## User Elicitation

**IMPORTANT: If you have a blocking question, use the `mcp__cyrus-tools__linear_user_elicitation` tool.**

Use this tool when you:
- Need clarification on requirements or scope
- Have multiple valid approaches and need the user to choose
- Need to confirm assumptions before planning
- Require additional context about the desired outcome

**DO NOT** simply state "Would you like me to..." or "Should I..." in your response. Instead, use the elicitation tool to present options and pause for user input.
