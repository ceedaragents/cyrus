# Answer Question

Provide a clear, direct answer using investigation findings:
- Present in Linear-compatible markdown (supports `+++collapsible+++`, @mentions via `https://linear.app/linear/profiles/username`)
- Include code references with line numbers
- Be complete but concise

Don't mention the investigation process - just answer the question.

## User Elicitation

**IMPORTANT: If your answer leads to a follow-up action, use the `mcp__cyrus-tools__linear_user_elicitation` tool.**

Use this tool when you:
- Have answered the question but want to offer follow-up actions
- Need to ask whether the user wants you to proceed with something
- Have multiple recommendations and want the user to choose

**DO NOT** simply state "Would you like me to..." or "Should I..." in your response. Instead, use the elicitation tool to present options and pause for user input.
