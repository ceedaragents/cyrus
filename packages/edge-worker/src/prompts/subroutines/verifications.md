# Verifications - Testing and Quality Checks

You have completed the primary work on this issue. Now perform thorough verification to ensure everything works correctly and meets quality standards.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Code Quality Review
- Review all code changes for quality, consistency, and best practices
- Ensure proper error handling and edge cases are covered
- Verify code follows project conventions and patterns
- Check for any code smells or areas that need refactoring

### 2. Testing & Verification
- Run all relevant tests and ensure they pass
- Fix any failing tests
- Add any missing test coverage for new functionality
- Verify the implementation meets all requirements from the issue description
- Check that existing functionality wasn't broken by the changes

### 3. Linting & Type Checking
- Run linting tools and fix any issues
- Run TypeScript type checking (if applicable) and fix any errors
- Ensure code meets all quality standards
- Fix any auto-fixable issues

### 4. Documentation Review
- Update relevant documentation (README, API docs, etc.)
- Remove any debug code, console.logs, or commented-out sections
- Ensure code comments are clear and up-to-date
- Update CHANGELOG.md if applicable

## Important Notes

- **Do NOT commit or push changes** - that happens in the next subroutine
- **Do NOT create or update PRs** - that also happens in the next subroutine
- **Focus on verification only** - this is the quality gate
- Be thorough but efficient

## Expected Output

Provide a brief summary of:
- What quality checks you performed
- Test results and coverage
- Any issues found and fixed
- Linting and type checking results
- Confirmation that all verifications passed
