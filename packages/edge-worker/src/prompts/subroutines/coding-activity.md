# Implementation Phase

Implement the requested changes:
- Write production-ready code
- Run tests to verify it works
- Follow existing patterns

**Do NOT**:
- Commit, push, or create PRs (later phases handle that)
- Touch the changelog (a separate subroutine handles changelog updates)

Complete with: `Implementation complete - [what was done].`
