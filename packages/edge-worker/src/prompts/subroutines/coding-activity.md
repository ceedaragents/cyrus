# Implementation Phase

Implement the requested changes:
- Write production-ready code
- Run tests to verify it works
- Follow existing patterns

**Do NOT**: commit, push, or create PRs (next phase handles that)

## User Elicitation

**IMPORTANT: If you have a blocking question, use the `mcp__cyrus-tools__linear_user_elicitation` tool.**

Use this tool when you:
- Need clarification on requirements or acceptance criteria
- Have multiple valid implementation approaches and need the user to choose
- Encounter an ambiguous situation that requires user decision
- Need approval before making a significant architectural choice

**DO NOT** simply state "Would you like me to..." or "Should I..." in your response. Instead, use the elicitation tool to present options and pause for user input.
