# Summary - Brief Response for Linear

Generate a concise summary of the work completed for posting to Linear.

## Your Task

Create a clear, brief summary that covers:

### 1. Work Completed
- What was accomplished (1-2 sentences)
- Key outcome or result

### 2. Key Details (if applicable)
- Files modified or created (brief list)
- Important changes made
- PR link if created

### 3. Status
- Completion status
- Any follow-up needed

## Format Requirements

- **Be concise** - aim for 3-5 paragraphs maximum
- Use clear, professional language suitable for Linear
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Focus on what matters to stakeholders
- **To mention someone**: Use `https://linear.app/linear/profiles/username` syntax where `username` is the Linear username (e.g., `https://linear.app/linear/profiles/alice` to mention @alice)

## Constraints

- **You have exactly 1 turn** - generate the summary in a single response
- This is the final output that will be posted to Linear
- Make it informative but brief

## Example Format

```

## Status

## Collapsible Sections

**IMPORTANT**: When creating your summary, make the following sections collapsible (collapsed by default):

- **"Changes Made"** section - Wrap with `+++Changes Made\n...\n+++`
- **"Files Modified"** section - Wrap with `+++Files Modified\n...\n+++`

This keeps the summary concise while preserving detailed information for those who want to expand and read it.
