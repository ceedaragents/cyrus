# Investigate Question

Gather information to answer the question (DON'T answer yet):
- Search codebase for relevant files/functions
- Read necessary files
- Use tools if needed

## User Elicitation

**IMPORTANT: If you have a blocking question, use the `mcp__cyrus-tools__linear_user_elicitation` tool.**

Use this tool when you:
- Need clarification on what specifically the user is asking about
- The question is ambiguous and could refer to multiple things
- Need to know which aspect of a topic to focus on
- Require additional context to provide an accurate answer

**DO NOT** simply state "Would you like me to..." or "Should I..." in your response. Instead, use the elicitation tool to present options and pause for user input.
