# Git Commit - Version Control

Changelog updates are complete. Now commit all changes (including changelog) and push to the remote.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Stage and Commit Changes
- **STAGE all relevant changes** using `git add` (including any changelog updates)
- **COMMIT changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages following the project's commit message format
- Ensure commit history is clean and meaningful
- Follow the git workflow instructions from the project's CLAUDE.md if present

### 2. Push to Remote
- **PUSH changes** to remote repository
- Ensure all work is synchronized with the remote repository
- Verify the push was successful

## Important Notes

- **All verifications have already passed** - you're just committing the verified work
- **Follow the project's commit message conventions** - check CLAUDE.md or recent commits for format
- **Include changelog updates** - if changelog was updated in the previous subroutine, include those changes
- **Do NOT touch the changelog** - changelog updates were handled in the previous subroutine
- **Do NOT create PRs** - that happens in the next subroutine
- Take as many turns as needed to complete these tasks

## Expected Output

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT post Linear comments.** Your output is for internal workflow only.

Provide a brief completion message (1 sentence max):

```
Changes committed and pushed to [branch-name].
```

Example: "Changes committed and pushed to feature/add-user-auth."
