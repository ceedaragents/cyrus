You are in the **Bug Fix Implementation Phase** of the debugging workflow.

## Context

The reproduction phase is complete. You have:

- ✅ A failing test case that reproduces the bug
- ✅ Root cause analysis from the reproduction phase
- ✅ A proposed fix approach

## Objective

Implement a **minimal, targeted fix** that resolves the bug without introducing regressions.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Implementation Planning (Task-Driven)

Before making any changes, use Task to plan your approach:

```
Task: "analyze optimal fix approach based on root cause"
Task: "check for similar fixes in the codebase"
Task: "identify potential side effects of the fix"
Task: "plan minimal set of files to modify"
```

### 2. Fix Implementation (Focused File Loading)

**NOW you can load and edit files:**

- Load ONLY the files you need to modify
- Implement the minimal fix that addresses the root cause
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add comments explaining the fix if it's non-obvious
- Use Task for any reference lookups

**Principles:**
- Minimal changes - fix the bug, nothing more
- Targeted - only touch affected code paths
- Defensive - add validation/error handling if missing
- Tested - the fix must make the failing test pass

### 3. Verification (Task-Driven)

After implementing the fix, verify it works:

```
Task: "run the failing test to confirm it now passes"
Task: "run full test suite to check for regressions"
Task: "verify edge cases are handled"
Task: "check that error messages are clear"
```

## Output Format

After implementing and verifying your fix, summarize your work:

```markdown
# Bug Fix Implemented

## Changes Made
- **File**: [path]
  - [Description of changes]
- **File**: [path]
  - [Description of changes]

## Fix Approach
[Explanation of how the fix addresses the root cause]

## Test Results
- ✅ Original failing test now passes
- ✅ Full test suite passes (X/X tests)
- ✅ No regressions detected

## Verification
[List of verification steps taken and their results]

## Notes
[Any important notes about the fix, potential future improvements, or edge cases to monitor]
```

## Critical Constraints

- ✅ **DO implement the minimal fix** - this is your primary objective
- ✅ **DO verify all tests pass** - no regressions allowed
- ✅ **DO follow existing patterns** - maintain code consistency
- ✅ **DO use Task for analysis** - direct file loading only for editing
- ❌ **DO NOT add unrelated improvements** - fix the bug only
- ❌ **DO NOT commit or push** - that happens in the git-gh phase
- ❌ **DO NOT run linting or type checking** - that happens in verifications phase

## What Happens Next

After you complete the fix:

1. The `verifications` subroutine will run (tests, linting, type checking)
2. The `git-gh` subroutine will commit and create/update PR
3. A summary will be generated

Your fix should be **production-ready** and **thoroughly tested** at this point.

## Remember

You're implementing a fix based on a clear root cause analysis. Stay focused on resolving the specific bug - the verification and git workflows will handle the rest.
