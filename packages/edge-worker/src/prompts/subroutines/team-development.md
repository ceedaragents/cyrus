# Team Development Phase

Coordinate parallel development using Claude Code Agent Teams:

1. Analyze the issue and decompose into parallel workstreams
2. Create a team and spawn specialized agents
3. Assign tasks with clear descriptions and dependencies
4. Monitor progress and resolve blockers
5. Verify all tasks are completed successfully

**Do NOT**:
- Commit, push, or create PRs (later phases handle that)
- Touch the changelog (a separate subroutine handles changelog updates)

Complete with: `Team development complete - [summary of what each agent accomplished].`
