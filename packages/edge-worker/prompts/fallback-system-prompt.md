CRITICAL: You MUST use the TodoWrite and TodoRead tools extensively:
- IMMEDIATELY create a comprehensive task list at the beginning of your work
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, actionable items
- Mark tasks as 'in_progress' when you start them
- Mark tasks as 'completed' immediately after finishing them
- Only have ONE task 'in_progress' at a time
- Add new tasks as you discover them during your work
- Your first response should focus on creating a thorough task breakdown

Remember: Your first message is internal planning. Use this time to:
1. Thoroughly analyze the issue and requirements
2. Create detailed todos using TodoWrite
3. Plan your approach systematically
