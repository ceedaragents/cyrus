## Identified Problems

### 1. Cognitive Overload (High Priority)
**Problem**: Current prompt is information-dense (116 lines) with multiple nested instruction sets
**Evidence**: Template contains:
- Two-situation framework explanation
- Detailed workflow instructions
- Multiple command examples
- Extensive metadata sections
- Complex decision trees

**Impact**: Reduced attention to core tasks, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, potential information paralysis

### 2. Rigid Decision Framework (High Priority)
**Problem**: Binary Execute/Clarify model doesn't match real-world complexity
**Evidence**: Many issues fall into spectrum categories:
- Partially specified requirements
- Mixed clarity levels
- Technical debt requiring investigation + implementation
- Iterative refinement needs

**Impact**: Forced into inappropriate approach, suboptimal handling of complex scenarios

### 3. Limited Error Recovery (Medium Priority)
**Problem**: Minimal guidance for handling problems or edge cases
**Evidence**: Current prompt lacks guidance for:
- Unclear or conflicting requirements
- Implementation blockers
- Test failures
- Scope management
- Dependency issues

**Impact**: Inconsistent handling of problems, potential session failures

### 4. Tool Usage Inconsistency (Medium Priority)
**Problem**: TODO tool usage emphasized but not enforced
**Evidence**: 
- Tool detection happens post-execution
- No validation of tool usage patterns
- Limited feedback loops
- No enforcement mechanism

**Impact**: Inconsistent progress tracking, varied user experience

### 5. Output Quality Variability (Low Priority)
**Problem**: Vague final summary requirements
**Evidence**: 
- No structured output template
- Unclear length/detail expectations
- No relationship to completion status
- Inconsistent formatting

**Impact**: Variable quality of final deliverables, unclear completion status

## Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Streamlined Core Structure (High Impact, High Feasibility)
**Recommendation**: Reduce prompt length by 30-40% through progressive disclosure
**Approach**:
- Extract detailed instructions to separate sections
- Use clear hierarchy with essential information first
- Implement progressive revelation of details
- Focus on core task definition

**Expected Benefits**:
- Improved attention to primary objectives
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better adherence to key guidelines
- Faster initial processing

### 2. Enhanced Decision Framework (High Impact, Medium Feasibility)
**Recommendation**: Replace binary model with flexible approach spectrum
**Proposed Framework**:
- **Fully Specified**: Clear requirements + acceptance criteria → Direct implementation
- **Partially Specified**: Mixed clarity → Targeted investigation + iterative implementation
- **Under-Specified**: Unclear requirements → Full discovery process

**Expected Benefits**:
- Better handling of complex scenarios
- More appropriate approach selection
- Reduced forced binary decisions
- Improved user satisfaction

### 3. Improved Tool Workflow (Medium Impact, High Feasibility)
**Recommendation**: Implement structured tool usage patterns
**Approach**:
```markdown
# Required Tool Workflow
1. START: TodoWrite (create initial plan)
2. DISCOVER: Read/Grep (understand context)
3. IMPLEMENT: Edit/Bash (build solution)
4. VERIFY: Bash (test and validate)
5. COMPLETE: TodoWrite (mark completion)
```

**Expected Benefits**:
- Consistent progress tracking
- Improved tool usage patterns
- Better user experience
- Enhanced reliability

### 4. Error Recovery Patterns (Medium Impact, Medium Feasibility)
**Recommendation**: Include common error scenarios and recovery strategies
**Proposed Additions**:
- Handling ambiguous requirements
- Managing implementation blockers
- Dealing with test failures
- Scope management strategies
- Dependency resolution patterns

**Expected Benefits**:
- Reduced session failures
- Better problem handling
- Improved user experience
- More consistent outcomes

### 5. Structured Output Templates (Low Impact, High Feasibility)
**Recommendation**: Provide clear output format guidance
**Proposed Template**:
```markdown
# Summary Template
## Work Completed
- [Specific changes made]
## Issues Encountered  
- [Problems and resolutions]
## Next Steps
- [Remaining work or recommendations]
```

**Expected Benefits**:
- Consistent output quality
- Clear completion status
- Better user communication
- Improved documentation

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Factors

#### 1. Template Loading Architecture
- **Current**: Hierarchical template resolution (repository → global → built-in)
- **Consideration**: Changes must maintain backward compatibility
- **Impact**: Template modifications affect all deployments

#### 2. Variable Substitution System
- **Current**: Simple string replacement with 15+ variables
- **Consideration**: New structure must preserve all context information
- **Impact**: Changes may require variable restructuring

#### 3. Streaming Integration
- **Current**: Real-time updates via streaming input
- **Consideration**: Prompt changes must work with streaming architecture
- **Impact**: Template modifications affect live conversations

#### 4. Tool Detection Logic
- **Current**: Post-execution tool detection for TodoWrite
- **Consideration**: Enhanced tool workflow may require detection changes
- **Impact**: May need updates to EdgeWorker message handling

### Configuration Constraints

#### 1. CLI vs EdgeWorker Modes
- **Current**: CLI strips custom templates, EdgeWorker allows customization
- **Consideration**: Changes must work consistently across modes
- **Impact**: Template modifications affect deployment flexibility

#### 2. Repository-Specific Overrides
- **Current**: Limited customization options in CLI mode
- **Consideration**: Enhanced templates may increase customization demand
- **Impact**: May require architecture changes for flexible customization
