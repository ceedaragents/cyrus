# Cyrus Marketing Video - Frame Analysis & Critique

## Executive Summary

**Overall Quality: 1.5/10 - FAILED**

All four clips produced by Sora 2 Pro are essentially **static screenshots with zero animation**. The model completely ignored animation/camera movement instructions and instead placed the input images as flat, unmoving elements.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why All Clips Failed:

1. **Sora's Image-to-Video Limitation:** The model appears to treat image-to-video as "place image in scene" rather than "animate the image content"

2. **Over-Complex Prompts:** My prompts were too descriptive with too many elements, potentially confusing the model

3. **Wrong Approach:** Image-to-video may not be suitable for these product screenshots - they're already static UI captures

### What Needs to Change:

1. **Simpler Prompts:** Focus on ONE primary motion (camera push, dolly, zoom)
2. **Clear Motion Instructions:** Be explicit about the exact camera/object movement
3. **Fewer Elements:** Don't request lighting + camera + animation + text all at once
4. **Consider Alternative:** May need pure text-to-video for some shots

---

## Revised Strategy

### New Approach:

**Clip 1 (Logo):**
- Simple: "Slow camera push towards logo. Warm lighting."

**Clip 2 (Linear):**
- Simple: "Smooth camera dolly right across interface. Natural light."

**Clip 3 (Claude):**
- Simple: "Gentle camera tilt down through code. Soft focus."

**Clip 4 (Workflow):**
- Simple: "Slow camera pullback from screen. Golden hour."

### Key Changes:
- ONE motion per clip
- Ultra-simple language
- No multiple simultaneous requests
- Focus on camera movement ONLY
- Minimal aesthetic descriptors

---

## Recommendation

**Regenerate all 4 clips** with dramatically simplified prompts that focus exclusively on camera movement. Test if Sora can produce ANY motion at all before adding complexity.

If this fails again, consider:
1. Using pure text-to-video instead of image-to-video
2. Using different model/service
3. Manual motion graphics in After Effects
